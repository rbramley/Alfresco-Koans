# Alfresco Koans

_Learning is a journey_, the idea behind the koans is that you perform **self-guided learning** of the Alfresco APIs through code. You need to fix the broken tests to make them pass.

The tests should progress through the different concepts such as Store, Node, Actions, Rules, Web Scripts etc.
